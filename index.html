                        <p style="font-size:18px">This is actually part of a series of characters for a Dungeons and Dragons campaign. Still not quite done, I'm not totally happy with it, but it's come along nicely.</p>

                        <p style="font-size:18px">Spring</p>
                        <p style="font-size:18px">I was inspired by John Milton’s Paradise Lost to make a comic book with no words that explores the morality, utility, and vanity of the characters in the book and by extension all of humanity. The image displayed below is a PNG and thus subject to compression, for the raw image in full resolution with very little compression please click <a href="https://github.com/high-tech-hobo/portfolio/blob/master/pictures/paradise_made/milton_comic_cover.tif?raw=true">HERE</a>.</p>

                        <p style="font-size:18px">I have since done some testing screen printing this cover while I work on the inside of the book. The greyscale halftone black ink layer is below. This looks very similar, but if you open the raw files and zoom in you can see that the one below is made up of different sized black dots. The density of those dots when you zoom back out results in all the different shades of grey needed to create the image.</p>

                        <p style="font-size:18px">I used a LSTM text generating neural network to teach a computer english using only the messages I had sent at the time of deleting my facebook and downloading a copy of all the data they had on me. Needless to say the computer did not learn very good english. It did however learn phonemes, which are sounds with meaning, almost like syllables, but even shorter, like the phonetic breakdown of words. I plan on revisiting this when I get back into the swing of programming, and make it a little more interactive, like being able to talk to myself, but only the version of me that was on facebook.</p>

                        <p style="font-size:18px">An internet based project, currently taking the form of performance art, where a friend and I are posting a color a day, iterating through the RGB color spectrum. Long term goals are to automate the process and start a longer version that could theoretically run for 47,000 years.</p>

                        <h4 style="font-size:18px">Final</h4>
                            <p style="font-size:18px">This project started with a romanticized vision of my return to art making after spending 2.5 years in engineering. After some initial critiques, and chatting with visiting artists, I settled on this idea of taking that core symbol of my favorite childhood toy, the 2x4 LEGO brick, and toying with the construction of it. I had seen this video at some point, and had been playing with silicon, so I decided I wanted to make a “flesh brick”. A LEGO fetus if you will. A soft fleshy, mildly revolting, and definitely infantile in a bad way LEGO brick. To go along with that I picked up screen printing to produce books of “Impossible Instructions” to be used with this brick. They are blank. I like to let people draw their own conclusions, so I shall leave it there with a description.</p>

                            <p style="font-size:18px">This is the image used to burn the screen I used to ink directly onto the pedestal. I had just started the process of printing and hand cutting out the letters when I realized it was going to be beyond slow. So I took a risk with my freshly sanded and painted pedestal and tried screen printing right onto the side, and it worked out great.</p>

                        <p style="font-size:18px">Various Breads and Butters Sticker. 
                            This was for a podcast hosted by two professors at Lafayette College. They had long had a sticker of a person sitting in a chair, but the head had been replaced with a loaf of bread. We referred to this character as "The Bread Head". I got a chuckle out of this with the reference to the Grateful Dead, so I made this sticker for them.</p>
