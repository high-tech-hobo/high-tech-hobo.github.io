                <h2>Paradise Made Poster</h2>
                    <h3>Spring and Summer, 2019</h3>
                    <p>I have been working to incorporate a laser cutter into printmaking at the Experimental Printmaking Institute, and in doing so I hope to produce a poster version of my Paradise Made comic book cover. This is an ongoing process, but some of the progress is shown below, in roughly chronological order.</p>
                    <h4>Laser Testing</h4>
                        <P>The whole process started with learning how to use the laser cutter. I very quickly realized I was not getting the quality I expected, so I taught myself how to refocus the laser, and generally gave the whole thing a tune up. After doing that I could begin to work with actual images. The end goal here is to be able to etch plexiglass plates to then ink and print. That being said I did not want to waste much plexi dialing in the settings, so I used paper at first.</P>
                    <br>
                        <p>This is the final test before I moved on to plexi.</p>
                    <img class=fixed src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/high-tech-hobo/portfolio/master/pictures/paradise_made/laser-test.png"/>

                    <h4>Moving to Plexi</h4>
                        <p>So once I was comfortable with the laser I began testing on small amounts of plexi. This meant figuring out how I was going to achieve shading once I inked a plate. When giving the laser an image there are many different options of dithering. I made a true gradient in a graphics editor and then applied each of the lasers dithering patterns to it, etched it into a plate, inked it, and printed it.</p>
                    <img class=fixed src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/high-tech-hobo/portfolio/master/pictures/paradise_made/gradient-test.png">
                    <p>This is the second test because I also experimented with sanding at this point. A light amount of sanding ended up being the best and the results of that are the image above. I also wasn't totally happy with any of these shading patterns for my purposes, so I went with another method. The last row of the test above is called 'threshold' and activates the laser when a given pixel is a certain shade of grey and above. With this I could define my shading in my graphics editor and then cut my image with threshold and any pixel I want to end up with ink will be cut.</p>
                    
                    <h4>Image Testing</h4>
                        <p> After doing the above testing I used a halftone pattern to define shading from the original image, and then cut a small portion of the full image to ink and test. I plan on actually using white ink for this, so the area of the plate I etched with the laser is where the original image has white space.</p>
                    <img class=fixed src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/high-tech-hobo/portfolio/master/pictures/paradise_made/white-test.png">

                    <h4>Full Plate</h4>
                        <p>So after all this testing I was ready to cut a full plate. It's not perfect, but it is very usable and serves as a good example of what this process is capable of. The colors of these proofs are inverted from the final piece because I only had a small amount of black paper that would hold up to the white ink, as that ink is very sticky. At the moment the cut is a little too deep, and really holds on to a lot of ink. This in combination with how sticky the white ink is poses a real threat to any type of paper I might use. So the plate will need to be recut, but I am very happy with how these proofs looks.</p>
                    <img class=fixed src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/high-tech-hobo/portfolio/master/pictures/paradise_made/current-plate.png">
                    <img class=fixed src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/high-tech-hobo/portfolio/master/pictures/paradise_made/current-proof.png">

                    <h4>Paper Testing</h4>
                        <p>With a usable plate the next step I needed to tackle was getting black paper. Thus far I had been largely using scraps from the studio for my testing and I wanted to try and keep that going. The studio I have been working in keeps a lot of scrap paper, and recently got a paper pulper. Before getting the pulper working I did some small scale testing making my own paper using a blender and screens.</p>
                    <img class=fixed src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/high-tech-hobo/portfolio/master/pictures/paradise_made/paper-test.png">
                    
                        <p>The 3 large grey pieces were made by mixing Sumi ink into the paper pulp slurry and then forming sheets of varying thickness. The color of these was not dark enough, so I did some small scale tests. The 4 small pieces on the right from top to bottom are: Dry white paper soaked in Sumi ink, pre-soaked white paper in Sumi ink, the grey paper pre-soaked in water them ink, and a dry piece of grey paper soaked in Sumi ink. Of these the best one is the grey paper, pre-soaked and them soaked in ink. The paper pulper is now up and running, so some larger scale tests can be done. The paper pulper is a sort of <a href="https://www.paperslurry.com/2013/07/12/the-critter-paper-beater-is-dandy-for-hand-papermaking-studios/">kit</a> that I helped source a motor for and then wired that motor and mounted it to the rest of the machine.</p>

                    <img class=fixed src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/high-tech-hobo/portfolio/master/pictures/paradise_made/paper-beater.jpg">

                    <h4>Current State</h4>
                        <p>This pretty much concludes where this project is at the moment. Testing and experimenting with paper is currently underway, but once something usable is produced I can begin testing the plate on that paper with white ink. In the meantime I will recut the plate to be a bit less deep, which should improve image quality.</p>

                    <h2>Paradise Made</h2>
                        <h3>Spring, 2018</h3>
                        <p>I was inspired by John Milton’s <u>Paradise Lost</u> to make a comic book with no words that explores the morality, utility, and vanity of the characters in the book and, by extension, all of humanity. The image displayed below is a PNG and thus subject to compression, for the raw image in full resolution with very little compression please click <a href="https://github.com/high-tech-hobo/portfolio/blob/master/pictures/paradise_made/milton_comic_cover.tif?raw=true">HERE</a>.</p>

                        <p>Since developing this cover image I have since done some test screen printing of it while I work on the inside of the book. The greyscale halftone black ink layer is below. This looks very similar, but if you open the raw files and zoom in you can see that the one below is made up of different sized black dots. The density of those dots when you zoom back out results in all the different shades of grey needed to create the image.</p>

                        <p>I used an <a href="https://machinelearningmastery.com/text-generation-lstm-recurrent-neural-networks-python-keras/"> LSTM</a> text generating neural network to teach a computer English using only the messages I had sent prior to downloading the data from, and then deleting, my Facebook account. Needless to say, the computer did not learn very intelligible English. It did however, learn phonemes, which are sounds with meaning, almost like syllables, but even shorter, like the phonetic breakdown of words. I plan on revisiting this to make it a little more interactive, like being able to talk to myself, but only the version of me that was on Facebook.</p>

                    <h2>Portrait of an Artist as a Young Engineer</h2>
                    <h3>Fall, 2017</h3>
                        <h4>Installation</h4>
                            <p>This project started with a romanticized vision of my return to art after spending 2.5 years in engineering. After some initial critiques and chatting with visiting artists, I settled on this idea of taking that core symbol of my favorite childhood toy, the 2x4 LEGO brick, and experimenting with the construction of it. I had seen <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2O7vyKnYfo">this</a> video at some point, and had been playing with silicone, so I decided I wanted to make a “flesh brick” &mdash; a LEGO fetus if you will. A soft, fleshy, mildly revolting, and definitely infantile brick would endeavor to evoke a sense of the famous coming of age novel by Jame Joyce from which the piece's name is taken. To go along with that, I picked up screen printing to produce books of “Impossible Instructions” to be used with this brick of life. They are blank. I like to let people draw their own conclusions, so I shall leave it there with a description.</p>
                            <img  src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/high-tech-hobo/portfolio/master/pictures/capstone/capstone_final.jpg"/>

                        <h4>Pedestal</h4>
                            <p>This is the image used to burn the screen I used to ink directly onto the pedestal of the exhibit. I had just started the process of printing and hand cutting out the letters when I realized it was going to be a tediously slow undertaking. So, I took a risk with my freshly sanded and painted pedestal and tried screen printing right onto the side, and it worked out great.</p>

                        <h4>Book Covers</h4>
                            <p>These are the black screen layer only, so where there is black in the image is where ink will be let through the screen.</p>

                            <p>This sticker was designed for the <i><a href= "http://wjrh.org/vbb/"> Various Breads and Butters</a></i> podcast hosted by two professors at Lafayette College. They had long had a sticker of a person sitting in a chair, but the head had been replaced with a loaf of bread. We referred to this character as "The Bread Head". I took this shameless poaching of the Grateful Dead, and developed the parody to its fullest extent.</p>

                    <h2>Day Blind Stars</h2>
                        <h3>Summer, 2016</h3>
                        <p>I've always loved stars. For me, being able to see stars at night was a factor when picking out colleges. Inspired by the text of <i>The Peace of Wild Things</i> by Wendell Berry I wanted to make a peace of my own that celebrated the night time. Starting with the stippled image I inverted the colors to produce the final image. This very much relates to the multiple inversion of an image required by the screen printing process, as well as positive and negative sculpts and casts.</p>
